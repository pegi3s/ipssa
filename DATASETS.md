# Mycobacterium leprae test dataset

Download, uncompress it and move to the `ipssa-m-leprae` directory, where you will find: (1) a directory called `ipssa-m-leprae-project`, that contains the files required by the pipeline as described in the README; (2) a file called `run.sh`, that contains the commands to test the pipeline (you should set the `PROJECT_DIR` path).
